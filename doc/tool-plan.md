⏺ Recommended improvements based on Claude Code and VSCode Copilot:

  1. Implement Structured Function Calling:
    - Use an XML-like format or JSON structure for function calls
    - Replace the current text pattern matching with proper parsing
  2. Define JSON Schemas:
    - Create schemas for each tool that define parameters and types
    - Validate parameters against these schemas
  3. Support Multiple Function Calls:
    - Modify the code to handle multiple tool calls in a single response
    - Process calls in parallel where appropriate
  4. Reduce Prompt Engineering Complexity:
    - Move function calling logic from the prompt to the code
    - Make the prompt simpler and more focused on describing tools
  5. Improve Error Handling:
    - Add better error recovery and fallback mechanisms
    - Provide clearer error messages
  6. Add Parameter Type Checking:
    - Validate parameter types before execution
    - Convert parameter values to appropriate types
  7. Implement Function Call Streaming:
    - Support streaming function calls for better UX
    - Process partial results as they arrive

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze current function call implementation in tools.go
     ☒ Compare with Claude Code and VSCode Copilot approaches
     ☒ Identify key limitations in the current implementation
     ☒ Suggest improvements based on Claude Code and VSCode Copilot

⏺ To summarize, your current implementation in src/repl/tools.go relies on pattern matching and prompt engineering to extract tool calls from LLM responses.
  This approach has several limitations compared to Claude Code and VSCode Copilot's more structured function calling mechanisms.

  Claude Code and VSCode Copilot use native function calling features with structured formats (XML-like or JSON), schema validation, and support for multiple
   concurrent function calls. They rely less on prompt engineering and more on built-in model capabilities.

  To improve your implementation, consider adopting a more structured approach with JSON schemas, better parameter handling, multiple function call support,
  and improved error handling. This would result in a more robust and flexible tool calling system comparable to what's available in Claude Code and VSCode
  Copilot.

  ⏺ You're right - keeping the markdown format makes sense for portability across models. The real issues are context retention between iterations and planning
   capabilities.

  I see two main problems:

  1. Context Loss: In src/repl/repl.go (lines 800-873), each tool execution is isolated. Previous context isn't properly fed back to the model, so it can't
  maintain a coherent plan.
  2. Limited Planning: The prompt (tool.md) focuses on individual tool selection rather than multi-step planning.

  Suggested improvements:

  1. Context Retention:
    - Maintain a history of tool calls and results in the input context
    - Include previous reasoning and outcomes in each new prompt
  2. Improved Planning Prompt:
    - Add explicit planning instructions: "Create a multi-step plan before selecting tools"
    - Encourage the model to reason about the full solution path
    - Add a "Plan:" section to the response format
  3. State Tracking:
    - Track what's been tried and what's still needed
    - Pass this state information in each iteration

    ----

⏺ I've implemented all the requested improvements:

  1. Enhanced Planning Prompt
    - Updated tool.md to emphasize multi-step planning
    - Added explicit sections for plan creation and progress tracking
    - Added guidelines for maintaining context between steps
  2. Context Retention in repl.go
    - Added a contextHistory array to store previous steps and results
    - Included previous context in each new prompt
    - Limited context history to prevent token overflow (last 3 steps)
    - Added step counting to help the model track progress
  3. State Tracking in Tool Execution
    - Added Plan, Progress, and StepNumber fields to the Tool struct
    - Updated parsing code to extract plan and progress information
    - Enhanced executeToolsInMessage to include state in the results
    - Added colorized output for plan and progress information
  4. Improved Prompting Structure
    - Added clearly defined "Plan" and "Progress" sections to the prompt format
    - Encouraged the model to think holistically about the problem
    - Added explicit instructions for maintaining context between steps

  These changes should significantly improve the tool's ability to plan and execute multi-step tasks while maintaining context between iterations.

⏺ I've refactored the code as requested. Here's a summary of the changes made:

  1. Created a new function ProcessToolExecution in tools.go that encapsulates the tool execution logic
  2. The function takes the user input, client, and REPL interface as parameters
  3. Updated repl.go to call this new function instead of containing the implementation directly
  4. Made sure to maintain all the existing functionality including:
    - Context history tracking
    - Plan and progress extraction
    - Tool execution with action/next step handling
    - Debug logging

  This refactoring improves the codebase by:
  1. Better separation of concerns - tool execution logic now lives in tools.go
  2. Improved maintainability - changes to the tool execution logic can be made in one place
  3. Cleaner code in repl.go - reduced function size makes it easier to understand
  4. Preserved all existing functionality - no behavioral changes

  The implementation is complete and ready to use.
