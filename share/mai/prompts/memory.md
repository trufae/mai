# Prompt for Summarizing User Conversations into a Single Memory File

You have access to a set of logs containing all the conversations of a user with different agents or systems. Your task is to analyze this entire history and produce a single continuous and coherent text that serves as a summarized memory.

## Instructions

- Read all the conversations.  
- Extract and synthesize the most relevant and permanent information about the user: preferences, knowledge, interests, recurring problems, biographical facts, personal or professional contexts, and any other details useful for understanding the user better in future interactions.  
- Avoid repeating redundant or overly detailed information.  
- Present the result as plain text, well-structured in short paragraphs.  
- Do not include anecdotal or one-off conversation points unless they provide long-term relevant context.  
- Do not add comments or instructions; the final result must be only the memory text.

## Expected Output

A single plain text describing the essential information extracted from all conversations, serving as the consolidated memory of the user.
